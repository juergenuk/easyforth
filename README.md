# Easy Forth

Along the lines of [Easy 6502](http://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/), Easy
Forth is a small ebook for learning the Forth language. It includes a
JavaScript Forth interpreter inline, making it easy to try writing small Forth
programs.

This fork will add some information about Forth and the documentation skilldrick did.
